QuestionAnswerignTraining.py: contains the source code for training
TrainingOutput.txt: contains log output of training process
SampleQsGenerationExample.py: contains code for some sample question generation and their output
GeneratingExampleSentenceOutput.txt: log file containing the output of some target question followed by generated question

I have also added the .ipynb file where I trained for only 10000 samples and it contains the proper 
explanation/documentation for each line of codes.
